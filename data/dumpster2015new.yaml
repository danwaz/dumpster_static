We gave structure to our venture by investigating men and women who risk their lives for a living: coal miners in West Virginia, oil rig workers in Louisiana, loggers in Washington State. Daryl wrote; I took pictures. We rolled into Hoquiam and Aberdeen in Washington, sister towns hosting a Loggers Playday, an event that featured competitions based on logging skills. It took place in the local high school stadium, capacity around 1000. Somehow, we worked our way onto the field, and I found myself able to photograph whatever I wanted. Everyone was quite gracious. There was an axe toss competition, a log chopping competition, stuff like that. It was pretty badass. Also, though, kind of weird, cause here were all these skilled men exhibiting their abilities, embarking in good-natured competition; yet the framework for the whole event was based on a vocation in peril, a casualty of the decimated American logging industry. A 'Powder Monkey' is one of the badass motherfuckers who sets explosives a hundred feet up a tree to fell it from the halfway point down."

I found a shopping cart at the top a hill and thought, well, you know... Halfway down the hill, the speed got a little intimidating, so I put a foot down to create drag. When it failed to slow me down sufficiently, I decided that putting the other foot down was a good idea, as it would create more drag. Unfortunately, it also created a fulcrum -- immediately. I hit the ground hard and just remember looking up to watch the shopping cart bounce off the pavement, creating a dramatic spark. Fortunately, all that really happened to me was that I ripped out my fingernail, probably broke the tip of my finger (which was bandaged with the pictured gauze and medical tape). Two years later, that same hill was used for the street luge course in the inaugural X-games."

But let me clarify: not just anything. The stuff people bring to me is kind of specific, and makes them think of me. It is an honor and something I find life affirming and humbling. So Stephen emailed me and told me that he had his wisdom teeth removed and that they were huge and he got to keep them and do I want them. I said 'OF COURSE.' Stephen brought me his teeth and I was like 'RAD, they are huge,' and right then and there I put them under the lights, photographed them for The Dumpster Project.

Outside Fenway, my dad offered a scalper $20 for two pretty decent tickets, figuring it didn't hurt to ask. Apparently, it did hurt: the very soul of the scalper. He swore a blue streak, talked about how good the tickets were, and how could such an insulting offer even cross my father's lips. It was inane and comical and an apt indication of that famed Northern hospitality. The seats we eventually got (from a slightly less belligerent citizen of Boston) were behind home plate. Tony Pena was catching for Boston that game. My dad and I drank beer and I talked about a girl I was pining over who was also named Pena and we watched ball. I don't remember who won. It was a great day at the Park."

But my mother asked me what I wanted one year so I said 'I don't know, a mitre box.' She ended up buying me a mitre box kit for model making. This is the handle for the saw. When she gave it to me, she said it reminded her of a little one her dad had. I tried very hard to utilize it, but it is too small for the jobs I do. I know my mother would just tell me to pass it on to someone who could use it then, maybe my cousin Chris, but she gave me something that reminded me of her Dad. That has a value I can't transfer."

Since I was not planning on purchasing a bird, I only spent about 10 minutes walking Bird Alley; it was very noisy. I have heard that it is no longer, a casualty of the handover, but I'm not sure of that. I found this label on the street about a year after my visit to Hong Kong. The graphics are wonderful. Also, the wording struck me: \"Beautiful Eastern Bird, Made In China\". The idea that a living being could have the origin of its creation claimed and labeled seemed very Chinese to me. Perhaps I've just offended a billion people. Oh well."

These really were the most lovely gloves I have ever been in possession of. I wore them openly, figuring someone in the neighborhood would say 'Hey, I lost those', and I would happily return them, commending him on his taste in handwear. Instead, I lost one that winter.

When I was in college and visiting my dad for holiday breaks, I'd ride into work with him and spend my days wandering around Pedro, mainly looking for Bukowski. One day I found a small barber shop and went in to get my kitchen cleaned. The proprietor of the shop was a five-foot tall and wide woman named Marvah Oh. I soon learned that she didn't usually cut white people's hair, but she'd clean me up, no problem. From then on, every time I went to Pedro, I'd spend a good portion of the day hanging out in Marvah Oh's International Style Center, smoking cigarettes and talking to Marvah, her daughter (who also cut hair there), and an assortment of people I had never met and would never see again. 'Mac's ok', she'd explain to them, 'he's from Chocolate City'. After a couple years absence, I returned to San Pedro only to find Marvah's doors shut. There was no longer a barber shop there. There was no shop at all. It was just an empty storefront. I stopped the next person passing by, a Mexican kid around twenty, and asked him if he knew what happened to Marvah Oh. He smiled and shook his head. 'She die,' he said. 'Too bad. She nice lady.' "
