We gave structure to our venture by investigating men and women who risk their lives for a living: coal miners in West Virginia; oil rig workers in Louisiana; loggers in Washington State. Daryl wrote, I took pictures. We rolled into Hoquiam and Aberdeen in Washington, sister towns hosting a Loggers Play-Day, an event that featured competitions based on logging skills. It took place in the local highschool stadium, capacity around 1000. Somehow, we worked our way onto the field, and I found myself able to photograph whatever I wanted. Everyone was quite gracious. There was an axe toss competition, a log chopping competition, stuff like that. It was pretty badass. Also, though, kind of weird, cause here were all these skilled men exhibiting their abilities, embarking in good-natured competition; yet the framework for the whole event was based on a vocation in peril, a casualty of the decimated American logging industry.A 'Powder Monkey' is one of the badass motherfuckers who sets explosives a hundred feet up a tree to fell it from the halfway point down."

I found a shopping cart at the top a hill and thought, well, you know..... Half way down the hill, the speed got a little intimidating, so I put a foot down to create drag. When it failed to slow me down sufficiently, I decided that putting the other foot down was a good idea, as it would create more drag. Unfortunately, it also created a fulcrum -- immediately. I hit the ground hard and just remember looking up to watch the shopping cart bounce off the pavement, creating a dramatic spark. Fortunately, all that really happened to me was that I ripped out my fingernail, probably broke the tip of my finger (which was bandaged with the pictured gauze and medical tape). Two years later, that same hill was used for the street luge course in the inaugural X-games."

On 3rd and 2, the Colts ran an option play and completed a 40 yard pass for a touchdown.  In the end the Patriots won,  23 -17. At season's end, the Patriots had won 6 games, the Colts just 1."

So Stephen emailed me and told me that he had his wisdom teeth removed and that they were huge and he got to keep them and do I want them. I said 'OF COURSE'. Stephen brought me his teeth and I was like 'RAD, they are huge,' and right then and there I put them under the lights, photographed them for The Dumpster Project.

A decade of good intention can be mitigated by virtue of a wind's shift. But what are you supposed to do, spend your life predicting the wind? No. The answer to every single question is the same : Work harder. Yet the caveat is in plain site. As if tipping its own hand, the same piece of paper that preaches the merit of the ol' protestant work effort also includes lucky numbers. Just in case all that hard work fails to pay off, there's always the lottery."

He was raised on a farm in Wisconsin, then spent most of his life in Rochester, New York  working as an engineer with the railway. Like me, he was the lucky father of two daughters.

It is considered and considerate and based on the ethos of respecting the sanctity of the individual. The constantness of that is tempered with what would appear to be a dismissive attitude toward the petty. Example: Hunter finds it incomprehensible to take advantage of one's mistake, like keeping the wrong amount of change given. Incomprehensible. But taking a table marker, it just doesn't really matter. The former is integral to a shared system of honesty; the latter is one of many pieces of plastic with a letter on it."

The idea is that you come and see this play in his living room (an audience of about 12), and when it is over, you take with you one of his books. When Ed is out of books, the show will close, and Ed will be done with writing plays. It is a stunningly crafted deaccession. Put another way, an artful fuck you. This is the book I took with me.

The board was not purchased to use, but as a relic; it was a G&S brand Stacey Peralta (of Powell & Peralta). It had these tiny Gullwing brand trucks and big ass Bowl Roll brand wheels. It was $20 and hilarious. A millennium later, at 24, I was too old to fly at speed against better judgement. It was then that I rediscovered this Stacey Peralta model G&S board with tiny Gullwings and big ass Bowl Rolls, and used it so much over the next few years that the holes in the baseplate of the rear truck wore away from the tension caused by dragging my back foot to slow down. I often say that I feel more comfortable on a skateboard than I do on my own feet.

During a hiatus in shooting during the summer of 2011, George returned to Brooklyn. He and I met for a beer. I asked him what I should do with my life. We had some more beer and George gave me this, an uncoated Masterlock dial that he brought back for me from his visit to the Masterlock factory. I spun it on the bar top for the next hour while we had more beer, then told him I was putting it the dumpster. He said 'OK'."

    desc: "The story of Tom Tresh is a mildly bittersweet one. On one hand, he played shortstop for the Yankees, last one to start on opening day prior to Jeter. He broke a tie in a World Series game with a home run. Lots of good stuff. But his rookie year would prove his best, and Tom Tresh would die of a heart attack at only 60. In Florida, no less. So goes luck with less then expected returns, but still, from the outside, a good looking life. Above and beyond all that, this can be said about Tom Trsh: he was honored with an almost aesthetically perfect baseball card."

We would spend three days together, see 4 baseball games. We met in Detroit, caught a Tigers game. That night we drove to Cleveland, where we caught a game the next day. A Yankees game, I should say. The third day we drove to Pittsburgh, caught a double-header. Heaven. "

I can't tell you what those things are. I don't remember. Side note: Rich never showed up for a single interview. Konrad shrugged, lit another one of Adrianna's Marlboro Light 100's.

With grief comes the need to find respite from it, often in humor. Enter the need to eat. The evening after his funeral, the immediate family was to reunite in one of the hotel suites. We would pick up some Chinese food, reminisce or not, relax, watch TV and/or cry. My sister and my cousins and I went to find some dinner, and this is the menu from the place we found. There is part of me that has yet to stop laughing."

All of this is predictable banter about the passage of time and humanities strange dual-comprehension tendency. If you can think of how to make linear time feel less folded, I'm all ears. "

He had been born in that building, as had his father. David had the unfortunate generational timing to be alive when the computer came along, relegating the printing press a very large and oily and strange thing. As he moved out, I would visit, give him a buck or two for old stuff like this printing plate, try and help move a machine, usually fail, buy some more old stuff from him. Then he moved to Israel."

    desc: "This wooden disc is from when my cousin Chris worked in a shop that built yacht and private plane interiors, and the scraps he lovingly collected for me were all teak and beautiful. I painted it and printed an 'A' on it, featuring it in an animation called 'Seeing Seeing' I made with my buddy Jonny. I skipped a big fancy to-do to film it with him because he was leaving to move to Ireland a week later, and I was terrified of life without him. The 'A' printed on it is from the silk screens I burned for the sashes my wife and I donned at the completion of our wedding ceremony, hers saying 'WIFE', mine saying 'HUSBAND'. Its just a little piece of wood and some paint, sure, but with its variance of emotional association, this thing is a tome."
